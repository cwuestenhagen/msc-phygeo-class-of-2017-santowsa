# Tree Segmentation with FUSION

## Workflow: 

1. Creating n-th percentile of las-point-cloud with Percentage function.
    - Is controlled by the variables "d" (percentile) and "y" (colnumber in gridmetrics csv)
    
2. Creating CHM with CanopyModel.exe (FUSION)

    Short description CanopyModel (FUSION):
    
    The CanopyModel application from FUSION creates a canopy surface model using LIDAR point cloud. Output is a       
    surfacefile in DTM format. The tool uses the returns with the highest elevation to compute the surface model. The 
    applied /ground switch produces a canopy height model (CHM) by subtraction the earth surface model from the return 
    elevation. The switch /gridxy: is not kept variable because the setup of the variable did not work. The CHM is 
    required as input for the FUSION TreeSeq tool (McGaughey 2006).
    
3. Creating tree segmentation with TreeSeg.exe (FUSION)

    Short description TreeSeg (FUSION):
    
    The TreeSeg tool works with a watershed segmentation algorithm. Basis for the calculation of "basins" is a canopy   
    height model (CHM) and not point data files. Additionally a  ht_hreshold, the minimum height of object segmentation, 
    in our case a raster with the values of the 80. Percentile of CHM is entered. According to McGaughey (2006) "the 
    TreeSeg tool does not necessarily produce outputs that represent individual tress". In stands with dens canopy 
    density, the algorithm produces basins that represent more than one tree. Only under open stand conditions the basins     can represent individual trees. Beyond TreeSeg is sensitive to the resolution and amount of the input CHM. The tool      produces a metrics file in CSV-format, a shapefile containing high points and basin metrics, also another shapefile      containing basin (crown) outline and a ASCII raster map including basins.

![TreeSeg model with height point 10x10](D:/bild/10.jpeg)

## Conclusion

The first TreeSeg model with 1x1m has the best basin model in exchange with the CHM. The problem of TreeSeg.exe with dens canopy covers becomes clear here. The polygons are to small to represent the real crowns. The second model with 3x3m has average basin model and polygons, therefore should be considered as best to use. It becomes clear that the tool is very sensitve to the resolution of input data. In camparison of both models the 10x10m model shows very good polygons, but resolution (basin model) is to low, to detect single trees.
