#Assign the value of 2 to a variable called a and the value of 5 to a variable called b.
a=2
b=5
#Compute the sum, difference, product and ratio of a and b and store the results to four different variables called r1, r2, r3, and r4.
r1=a+b
r2=a-b
r3=a*b
r4=a/b
#Create a vector v1 which contains the values stored within the four variables from step 2
v1=c(r1, r2, r3, r4)
#Add a fifth entry to vector v1 which represents a by the power of b.
v1=c(r1, r2, r3, r4, a**b)
#Show the content of vector v1.

#Create a second vector v2 which contains information on the type of mathematical operation used to derive the five results.

#Show the content of vector v2.
